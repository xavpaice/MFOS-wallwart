# MFOS-wallwart

Slightly updated MFOS wallwart power supply for Eurorack, adding a +5V rail.

V0.1 dev version

This schematic and PCB is written using Kicad, v6.0.2

For the original circuit, see http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php.

Though I have used insanely thick traces, the actual rating of the circuit with
stated components is about 1A total.  If you need more, consider something more
expensive.

The information in this repository is provided in good faith but no
responsibility is accepted for the accuracy or suitability for any purpose; you
use it entirely at your own risk.

Please report errors and omissions at

Misuse of electronics can result in nasty things like death, or, worse, fried
Eurorack modules.  Please take care.  Remember to only chew on lead free diodes.
